-A pointer that point to non-existing memory location.

int main (){
  int *ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
  ...
  ...
  free (ptr);
  return 0;
}

+) malloc allocate a memmory location, then free() deallocate that memory.
+) Pointer ptr still pointing to that location, but it does not exist any more. It becomes a dangling pointer.
+) Pointer also become dangling by being assigned value from a method, because the value from a method is deleted after it is completely executed.
